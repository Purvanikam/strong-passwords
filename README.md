# Strong Passwords Repo
## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong, test passwords against online password-strength checkers, record results, and learn best practices.

## Structure
- README.md                (this file)
- PASSWORDS.md             (sample passwords & guidance)
- REPORT_TEMPLATE.md       (report table & sections to fill)
- CHECKERS_INSTRUCTIONS.md (how to test safely)
- SCRIPTS/
  - generate_passwords.py  (local password generator + entropy estimator)
- REFERENCES.md            (useful resources)
- .gitignore
- LICENSE

## How to use
1. Use `SCRIPTS/generate_passwords.py` to create sample passwords locally.
2. Test those (or the sample ones in PASSWORDS.md) on a password-strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com) in private mode. 
3. Fill `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` with the scores, feedback, entropy, and notes.
4. Submit the report (or convert to PDF) as your deliverable.

**Important safety note:** Never enter real account passwords into online checkers. Use only generated/test passwords.
