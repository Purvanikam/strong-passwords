# Sample Passwords 

> WARNING: Do NOT use any example passwords here for real accounts. These are for testing and learning only.

## Examples by complexity

### Very Weak
- `password123`
- `qwerty`
- `12345678`

### Weak
- `Summer2024`
- `JohnDoe1995`
- `ilovecats1`

### Moderate
- `BlueHouse2024`
- `MangoTree19`
- `Red$River2023`

### Strong
- `G7!vR3^k2Lq9`          (12 chars, mixed)
- `Bright?Lake!2024`     (16 chars, words + symbols)

### Very Strong (passphrase / long random)
- `correct-horse-battery-staple` 
- `sunflower+coffee=morning.repeat2024!`  (long unpredictable passphrase)

## Notes
- Passphrases (multiple unrelated words) usually give very good memorability + security.
- Longer is almost always better; aim for at least 12â€“16 characters for general use, 20+ for high-value accounts.
- Use a password manager to generate/store unique, random passwords per account.
