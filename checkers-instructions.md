# How to test passwords safely with online checkers

1. Open a private/incognito browser window to avoid storing test inputs in your history or autofill.
2. Prefer password checkers that run locally in your browser or state they do not transmit data.
3. Copy a single test password (from PASSWORDS.md or generated locally) and paste it into the checker input.
4. Note:
   - Numeric score (if provided)
   - Any textual feedback (e.g., 'too common', 'add symbols', 'increase length')
   - Any entropy estimate or cracking time estimate (if shown)
5. Record the results into `REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`.
6. NEVER enter a real password you use for any account. Use only test passwords or ones created for this assignment.

Suggested checkers:
- passwordmeter.com (interactive)
- zxcvbn-based demo sites (shows strength categories and suggestions)
